Proto App
=====

##Hi there! Thank you for dropping by. 
ProtoApp is a simple application to create workflow demo. 
It is done by simply creating hot spots on the image and linking the image to the target image. 
The process is quite simple ...
- Drop your images on the big fat "+drop files here" area on the left of the screen.
- Refresh the screen (this is necessary, otherwise the image will not appear, I am still working on the fix)
- Double click on the image to create hot spot, and you can position and resize them.
- Now double click on the hot spot created to make it accept target. Click on your target image on the left.
- That's it. You can view how it will look like clicking on preview button and finally click on export button to download the HTML page.
